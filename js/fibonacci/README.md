# Fibonacci Sequence

## How does it works?
*It's simple.*
**Fibonacci Sequence** *gets* the *last two numbers* to **generate** the *next one* in the row.

## How can I do it, then?
*It's simple too, but you have to think.*
You have to understand the sequence as variables first, then you can attribute numbers on it.

The sequence is based in a logical way that you just need three variables so you can generate it.

The beginning, the middle and the end. Fibonacci always starts with the number 1, so we call our first variable as begin and set it up to 1.
