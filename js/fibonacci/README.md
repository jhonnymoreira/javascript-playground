# Fibonacci Sequence

## What's Fibonacci Sequence?
Sorry, but [let me google it for you](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Fibonacci+Sequence).
***
## How does it works?
*It's simple.*
**Fibonacci Sequence** *gets* the *first two numbers* to **generate** the *next one* in the row.
***
## How can I do it, then?
*It's simple too, but you have to think.*
You have to understand the sequence as *variables first*, then you can attribute numbers on it.

The sequence is based in a logical way that you just need **three variables** so you can generate it. But first ~~Let me take a Selfie~~, we need examples. *Right?* **Right!**

> **Fibonacci Sequence [Real Example]**

> 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 ...

If we use only the first three elements, we get something like this:
> 1 1 2

Converting it to variables, we have:
> a b c

What did I said earlier?
> Fibonacci Sequence **gets the first two numbers** to generate the **next one** in the row.
