# Fibonacci Sequence

## What's the Fibonacci Sequence?
Sorry, but [let me google it for you](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Fibonacci+Sequence).
***
## How does it works?
*It's simple.*
**Fibonacci Sequence** *gets* the *last two numbers* to **generate** the *next one* in the row.
***
## How can I do it, then?
*It's simple too, but you have to think.*
You have to understand the sequence as *variables first*, then you can attribute numbers on it.

The sequence is based in a logical way that you just need **three variables** so you can generate it. But first ~~Let me take a Selfie~~, we need examples. *Right?* **Right!**

> **Fibonacci Sequence [Real Example]**

> 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 ...

If we use only the first three elements, we get something like this:
> 1, 1, 2

Converting it to variables, we have:
> a, b, c

What did I said earlier?
> Fibonacci Sequence **gets the last two numbers** to generate the **next one** in the row.

Understading it we conclude that the **c** is just **c** *= a + b*. Now we have:
> a, b, (a + b)

After all the explanation, the code begins!
